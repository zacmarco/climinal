CLIMINAL EXAMPLE
***********

This directory contains a sample CLI implementation,
just to show how to use CLIMINAL in a c++ project.
C++ threads are also used to show how to use the cookie parameter in a multi-thread environment.

Files in this directory are:

 - cpp.xml : main JSON file that contains the CLI structure
 - cpp_cbk.cpp : C++ file containing the command callbacks implementation
 - cpp_main.cpp : C++ file that just implements the main() function
 - README : this file ;)

In order to build this fully working example, please run the following commands,
after installing CLIMINAL libraries and tools



 my-linux-box$ climinalbuilder cpp.json cpp
 my-linux-box$ gcc -c *.c 
 my-linux-box$ g++ -c *.cpp
 my-linux-box$ g++ -o cpp *.o -lcliminal -lpthread -lm



Now you're ready to run the sample CLI application:

my-linux-box$ ./cpp

ENJOY

  Zac
