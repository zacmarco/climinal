CLIMINAL EXAMPLE
***********

This directory contains a sample CLI implementation,
just to show what are the needed elements to build a simple CLI.

Files in this directory are:

 - nettool.xml : main XML file that contains the CLI structure
 - nettool_cbk.c : C file containing the command callbacks implementation
 - nettool_main.c : C file that just implements the main() function
 - README : this file ;)

In order to build this fully working example, please run the following commands,
after installing CLIMINAL libraries and tools



 my-linux-box$ climinalbuilder nettool.xml nettool
 my-linux-box$ cc -o nettool *.c  -lcliminal -lm



Now you're ready to run the sample CLI application:

my-linux-box$ ./nettool

ENJOY

  Zac
